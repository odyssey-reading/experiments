        <h1>Examining the Problem of Bycatch</h1>

        <p>A topic of increasing relevance to the conservation of marine life is bycatch—fish and other
            animals that are unintentionally caught in the process of fishing for a targeted population of
            fish. Bycatch is a common occurrence in longline fishing, which utilizes a long heavy fishing
            line with baited hooks placed at intervals, and in trawling, which utilizes a fishing net (trawl)
            that is dragged along the ocean floor or through the mid-ocean waters. Few fisheries employ
            gear that can catch one species to the exclusion of all others. Dolphins, whales, and turtles
            are frequently captured in nets set for tunas and billfishes, and seabirds and turtles are caught
            in longline sets. Because bycatch often goes unreported, it is difficult to accurately estimate
            its extent. Available data indicate that discarded biomass (organic matter from living things)
            amounts to 25–30 percent of official catch, or about 30 million metric tons.</p>

        <p>The bycatch problem is particularly acute when trawl nets with small mesh sizes (smaller-
            than-average holes in the net material) are dragged along the bottom of the ocean in pursuit
            of groundfish or shrimp. Because of the small mesh size of the shrimp trawl nets, most of the
            fishes captured are either juveniles (young), smaller than legal size limits, or undesirable
            small species. Even larger mesh sizes do not prevent bycatch because once the net begins to
            fill with fish or shrimp, small individuals caught subsequently are trapped without ever
            encountering the mesh. In any case, these incidental captures are unmarketable and are
            usually shoveled back over the side of the vessel dead or dying.</p>

        <p>The bycatch problem is complicated economically and ecologically. Bycatch is a liability to
            shrimp fishers, clogging the nets and increasing fuel costs because of increased drag
            (resistance) on the vessel. Sorting the catch requires time, leading to spoilage of harvested
            shrimp and reduced time for fishing. Ecologically, high mortality rates among juvenile fishes
            could contribute to population declines of recreational and commercial species. Evidence to
            this effect exists for Gulf of Mexico red snapper and Atlantic Coast weakfish. Because the
            near-shore areas where shrimp concentrate are also important nursery grounds for many fish
            species, shrimp trawling could have a profound impact on stock size.</p>

        <p>Once the dead or dying bycatch is returned to the ecosystem, it is consumed by predators,
            detritivores (organisms that eat dead plant and animal matter), and decomposers (organisms
            that break down dead or decaying organic matter), which could have a positive effect on
            sport fish, seabird, crab, and even shrimp populations. Available evidence indicates that 40–
            60 percent of the 30 metric tons of catch discarded annually by commercial fishing vessels,
            and even more of the noncatch waste (organisms killed but never brought to the surface),
            does not lie unused on the bottom of the sea. It becomes available to midwater and ocean-
            bottom scavengers, transferring material into their food web and making energy available to
            foragers (organisms that search for food) that is normally tied up in ocean-bottom, deep-
            ocean, midwater, and open-ocean species.</p>

        <p>Overfishing and overdiscarding may thus contribute to a syndrome known as "fishing down
            of food webs," whereby we eliminate apex (top) predators and large species while
            transforming the ocean into a simplified system increasingly dominated by microbes,
            jellyfish, ocean-bottom invertebrates, plankton, and planktivores. The strongest evidence for
            the fishing down phenomenon exists in global catch statistics that show alarming shifts in
            species composition from high-value, near-bottom species to lower-value, open-ocean
            species. In the last three decades of the twentieth century, the global fishing fleet doubled in
            size and technology advanced immeasurably. Despite increased effort and technology, total
            catch stabilized, but landing rates (rates at which species are caught) of the most valuable
            species fell by 25 percent.</p>

        <p>Conservation organizations have condemned the obvious and extreme waste associated with
            bycatch. Public concern over high mortality rates of endangered marine turtles captured in
            shrimp trawls led to the development of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) in the 1980s. TEDs
            were incorporated into the shrimp net design with the purpose of directing turtles out of nets
            without unacceptably reducing shrimp catches. Marine engineers and fishers also developed
            shrimp net designs that incorporate bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), taking advantage of
            behavioral differences between shrimp and fish, or between different fishes, in order to
            separate fishes.</p>
