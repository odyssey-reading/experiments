    <h1>Learning from Penguin Poop</h1>
    <p>The unique features of penguin poop have allowed scientists to make a remarkable discovery. The faeces of Adelie
        penguins, which live along the Antarctic coast and its islands, have a unique colour. They are bright pink due
        to the
        penguins’ diet, which consists largely of pink creatures called krill. They eat so much of it that their
        plentiful poop
        stains the ground on which they live, as well as their own bodies. Moreover, they produce so much poop that the
        pink
        stains can be seen from space.</p>

    <p>This attribute has been useful for scientists studying these birds, as it has allowed them to locate colonies of
        penguins using satellite images. It isn’t possible to see individual penguins in satellite photos, but the pink
        stains
        are easy to identify. Scientists can even estimate the size of the colony from the size of the pink area.
        Researchers using this method were, until recently, reasonably certain that they knew the whereabouts of all the
        Adelie
        penguin colonies on the continent. However, a colleague at NASA then developed an algorithm which automatically
        detected
        these stains, rather than finding them by human eye. The computer programme identified many more pink patches
        that the
        researchers had previously overlooked, particularly in the Danger Islands.</p>

    <p>Researcher Heather Lynch admitted that the researchers had probably missed these colonies because they never
        expected to
        find them there. As the name suggests, the Danger Islands are difficult to get to and are almost always covered
        in sea
        ice. They are so small that they don’t even appear on many maps of Antarctica. However, once the researchers
        were aware
        of the colonies, they completed a full survey. They discovered 1.5 million penguins in this small area, more
        than in the
        rest of Antarctica.</p>

    <p>Although this seems a large number, research findings suggest that it is lower than previous years. By studying
        satellite images from the past, which date back to 1982, the team were able to deduce that penguin numbers
        peaked in the
        late 1990s, and have since declined by 10-20%. Krill fishing is one of the main causes for the population
        decline of
        penguins in Antarctica, but because the Danger Islands are normally surrounded by sea ice, there is less human
        activity
        here than in other parts of the continent. This leads researchers to believe that the recent decline is due to
        other
        factors, such as climate change.</p>

    <p>The scientists are now conducting research in the area to better understand the species and the long-term health
        of the
        colonies. One team, for example, is analysing the colour and content of the poop to investigate changes in the
        birds’
        diet. This can show the extent to which penguins are affected by commercial fishing. Another is digging holes to
        learn
        more about the penguins’ past. By radiocarbon dating the bones and eggshells found in these holes, the team have
        discovered that the penguins have been inhabiting these islands since 2,800 years ago. By learning more about
        the
        penguin population of Antarctica, the team hopes to understand more about the impact of human activity on the
        natural
        world.</p>
