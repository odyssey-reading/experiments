    <h1>Personality and Health</h1>
    <p>There is increasing evidence that health is linked to personality. However, until now, the relationship has not
        affected the way health care is delivered. There are several reasons for this. Some health workers doubt whether
        there is a direct link between health and personality or whether it’s just a coincidence. Some feel it is their
        professional duty to treat all patients in the same way. Others argue that delivering health services according
        to patients’ personalities will have minimal impact and therefore isn’t worth the effort. However, some
        psychologists believe that applying different procedures to people with different personalities could have a
        significant, positive effect on health.</p>

    <p>Research into personality has, in recent years, focused on the Big Five model of personality types. This model
        measures how neurotic, extrovert, open to experience, agreeable and conscientious a person is. Some of these
        personality types have been studied in relation to health. For example, conscientious people tend to be less
        likely to smoke, drink too much alcohol or be inactive. However, in other cases, the relationship is less clear.
        Neurotic behaviour, for instance, has been found in some studies to increase the risk of death, in others to
        protect people from illness and in others to have no link to health at all.</p>

    <p>Even so, if health workers applied an understanding of personality to the services they provide, they could
        influence the extent to which patients act on advice and follow their treatment. For example, high
        sensation-seeking individuals, who are extroverts and unconscientious in the Big Five model and tend to take
        part in risky activities, respond to drama, energy and emotion. Thus, to encourage those people to follow health
        advice, health promotions can be designed to incorporate those factors. An example of this was the campaign
        SENTAR which aimed to reduce cannabis use among high sensation-seeking teenagers. By creating a suitable
        television advert, they successfully engaged these youths and reduced their recreational drug use. Of course,
        this approach isn’t always possible. It is often impractical and expensive to create several versions of a
        campaign to reach different personality types. However, recent developments in computer technology, cookies and
        targeted advertising may allow this approach to be used more in future.</p>

    <p>Personality could also be considered when sending messages, information and guidance to specific patients.
        Already, health information is usually available in various forms – printed, digital, audio, and so on – to be
        suitable and accessible for different users, such as the blind, the elderly, and people with reading
        difficulties. Research has also shown that, by identifying different patients’ motivations for treatment and
        then corresponding with them in a way that reflects their motivations, patients will become more involved in
        their treatment, compared to when the same messages are sent to everyone. Correspondence could, therefore, be
        adapted to reflect patients’ personality type, too. For example, less conscientious people could be sent phone
        reminders to attend appointments. So far, there has been very little research into the effectiveness of
        tailoring health guidance according to personality, so this area deserves further study.</p>

    <p>Until now, the focus of personality-health research has been to explore the link between personality and health
        and has had very little practical application. Thus, health workers have not engaged deeply with it. However, by
        suggesting, trialling and implementing practices to engage patients with different personalities, the
        relationship between psychology researchers and health workers could improve, along with the health of the
        general public.</p>
