        <h1>UK Students Protest Covid-19 Measures</h1>
        <p><em>5th October 2020</em></p>
        <p>A group of UK university students are demanding partial refunds of their university fees, due to the
            coronavirus restrictions which have severely limited their university experience. This comes at a time when
            over 2,600 students and staff in 50 UK universities have confirmed cases of Covid-19. Thousands of students
            have been told to self-isolate, while face-to-face lessons have been replaced by online lectures. The group,
            Refund Us Now, has been asking for a 15% cash refund for all students who have been told lies and forced to
            comply with strict rules by their universities. The fifteen percent corresponds to the amount by which
            online learning was found to be less effective than in-person teaching, according to one international
            study.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the term, students were encouraged to attend campus. They were promised a safe university
            experience involving a blend of online and face-to-face teaching. Instead, many have been forced to stay
            inside halls of residence, socialising only with the students with whom they share kitchen and bathroom
            facilities. Many of them feel they have been abandoned and mistreated. At Manchester Metropolitan
            University, where 1,700 students in two accommodation blocks were told to self-isolate after more than 120
            tested positive, there are reports of security guards stopping students from leaving their halls, even when
            they were no longer required to self-isolate. Meanwhile, students at Leeds University were left without
            cleaning supplies or information about how to buy food or take out rubbish. They were also prevented from
            using laundry services and instead were told to buy more clothes or wash their clothes in the sink. Many
            students question why they were encouraged to return to university at all, given the availability of online
            learning. Outbreaks at universities were, they say, inevitable, and students shouldn’t have been encouraged
            to attend in person.</p>
        <p>University staff, meanwhile, have their own concerns. Staff at Northumbria University, for example, want more
            Covid-19 testing and more online teaching to allow for thorough cleaning and support teaching to take place
            and protect the health of themselves and their families.</p>
        <p>They have cause for concern. Covid-19 can spread very easily in student accommodation. It’s also very hard to
            monitor and enforce students’ activities there, unlike in the bars and restaurants that they are forbidden
            to visit. Despite hefty fines for breaking government rules of remaining in household groups, some students
            are organising parties for 20-25 people. The students who have tested positive for the virus feel most free
            to socialise with others who test positive. Some students feel they are better off catching the disease
            while they are among other young, healthy people and away from more vulnerable family members. Other
            students, however, keep to the rules. They use their isolation to bond with housemates or entertain
            themselves online. But inevitably, some are feeling mental and emotional strain, as well as anger and
            frustration over their less-than-perfect university experience.</p>
        <p>Will they get a refund? There are calls for students to get money back if the quality of their learning is
            severely impacted by the new conditions. However, students receiving adequate online learning and access to
            appropriate library and research facilities are ineligible. Meanwhile, students who have been told to
            self-isolate at short notice in student accommodation are receiving food, essential items and some financial
            assistance. It seems that students will have to accept their unfortunate university experience as just
            another unwelcome impact of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
